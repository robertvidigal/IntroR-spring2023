# Variable Types

![Saw](https://screencrush.com/files/2017/11/infinitywargif7.gif?w=750&h=305&q=75)

     Râ€™s basic data types are Numeric, Logical, Character, and Factor.

# Variable Types

In R, our data (or variables) can be of different types. The main data types are:

--

-  **Numeric**

  21, 60,000 

  _e.g.,_ Age or Income...
  
  3, 7, 50 or 0
  
  _e.g.,_ Political interest or Political tolerance...
  
--

-   **Logical**

  `TRUE` or `FALSE`
  
  _e.g.,_  Graduated or not, Enrolled or not, US Born or not...

# Variable Types

In R, our data (or variables) can be of different types. The main data types are:

-   **Character**
  
  "No I do not really know", "Student loan forgiveness"
  
  _e.g.,_ Cause of inflation or Name a policy of President Biden...
  
--

-   **Factor**

  Numeric codes with character-valued meaning (categorical).
  
  _e.g.,_ Race, College Major, U.S. State...

# Variable Types

.center[

**We need to be aware of the type (class) of our data.**
]

--

.center[
**R Functions and Operators that we use to transform and manipulate our data only work with some specific data types.**
]

--

- We can check for a variable type using the `class()` function or also specific logical functions for each variable type

  `is.numeric()`
  `is.logical()`
  `is.character()`
  `is.factor()`

# Data Structures

.center[
![Saw](https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/11/infinitywar8.gif?w=750&q=75)

**Data frames** are the most common type of data structure used in modern data analytics.
]
---
# Data Structures
Different types of data can be combined to form **Data frames**. They have two dimensions: 

--
-   **rows** (or observations).

--
-   **columns** (or variables).

--


Data frames are data displayed in a format as a table.


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
require(dplyr); require(kableExtra); require(formatR)
minidf<-data.frame(
  "name"=c("Juan", "Maia", "Fred", "Sasha", "Rachel"), # Individuals/UserIDs
  "age"=c(23, 22, 44, 26, 30), # Age in years
  "gender"=c(2, 1, 2, 3, 3), # Female 3, Male 2, Nonbinary 1
  "race"=c("Black", "White", "Hispanic", "Hispanic", "White"),
  "ideology"=c(7, 3, 4, 5, 1), # 7-point scale: left (1) and right (7)
  "vaccinated"=c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) # Logical
)
minidf$gender<-factor(minidf$gender, levels=c(1,2,3), labels=c("Non-binary", "Men", "Women"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
minidf %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Roboto")
```

Here, `minidf` has 5 observations (`rows`) and 6 variables (`columns`). 
---
# Data Structures
```{r}
str(minidf)
```
Data frames can have different types of data inside it. However, each column should have the same type of data.

# R Operators

.center[
![Saw](https://capricho.abril.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vingadores-originais-gif.gif)

An operator is a symbol that tells R to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.
]

---
## Numerical operators

R has several **math operators** for numeric data. These operators perform **arithmetic operations**. For example:

--
```{r}
5+10; 5-10
```

```{r}
5/10; 5*10
```

```{r}
5^10
```
---
## Logical operators

Logical operators are useful for **logical tests** or **comparison tests**, and they always output **TRUE** or **FALSE**. The most common ones are: `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<` 

--
```{r}
5 == 10
```

```{r}
5 != 10
```

```{r}
5 > 10; 5 < 10
```
---
## Assignment operators

These operators in R allows you to assign data to a variable in order to store the data. The left arrow operator ```(<-)``` is used to create or change variables.
```{r}
minidf$vote2022<-c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
minidf %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Roboto")
```
--


The dollar sign operator (**$**) is used to access variables in data frames.

```{r}
minidf$name
```

## RStudio Today

1. We will learn some of the most common variable types transformation.

2. We will learn some of R functions to explore data frames structure.
